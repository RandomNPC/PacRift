This is a test file.

Everything before the open curly brace is ignored. 

# = comment. /# and #\ are for block comments.

Format for objects: prefabName x;y;z;

White-space will be ignored.
Closing curly brace ends the map. everything after it is ignored as well.
Below is the test map. Modify with real values, so we can actually test it.

Currently the extension will be TXT, but I think we should make a custom extension because its cooler. like filename.DJPCMASTA or something.

{ #Map Begin

cubeA 1;1;1;
cubeB 100;100;100;

#This is a comment
/# This is a 	
	Block Comment #\


} #Map End
